<p class="intro">These bandanas are both mono printed and screen printed celebrating my first live stage performance of <a href="/wrave">Wrave</a>. It was collaboration between me, my father, and Stephen Lindberg.</p>
<p>During the late 1980s my father was introduced to monoprinting, a technique in which fabric ink is applied to glass, etched into very quickly, and then rolled directly onto the medium. Monoprints, as the name suggests, produce one-offs. Some time during the early 1990s he started producing bandanas. I've always treasured the bandanas that I've kept and given away a few only to those who were absolutely the closest to me.</p>
<p>Stephen Lindberg is a student at North Carolina State University's College of Design. He taught me how to produce a silkscreen in order to print logos in the corners.</p>
