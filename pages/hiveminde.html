<p class="intro"><em>Hiveminde</em> provides custom-built lights for clubs, parties, and shows around Raleigh. Occasionally, I VJ for them.</p>

<h2>The Look of Raleigh's Finest Dance Party</h2>

<p>The largest party in the whole state of North Carolina is <a href="http://disco-very.tumblr.com/">Discovery</a>. Part of its success has been Hiveminde's integral part in providing the "light bawrs" at most of their events. </p>

<p>On special occasions, I've also done VJ performances. The later of these took advantage of my previous experience with projection mapping. Now it's quite easy for us to build setups that appear to have many multiple projectors when in fact there is just one.</p>
