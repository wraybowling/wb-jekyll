<p class="intro"><em>The Gold Sparrow</em> is a short film. I animated the car that gets thrown.</p>

<p><em>The Gold Sparrow</em> was in production for roughly two years at <a href="http://artbelly.net/">Artbelly Studios</a> using the same method and software of rotoscoping as seen in <em>Waking Life</em> and <em>A Scanner Darkly</em>. I animated a car being picked up and thrown in a scene with a strongman. The neat thing about doing this project was that the model didn't need to be rendered with particularly detailed light or textures since everything would be rotoscoped afterwards by another artist.</p>
