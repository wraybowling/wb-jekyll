<p class="intro">Bill Fisher and I are fond of maps. This map, which we affectionately called the <em>Bowling-Fisher Polar Projection</em> is a purely custom-made map of Earth printed on fabric. It features no slices on any land masses except Greenland, a reduced amount of stretching when compared to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercatur Projection</a> (which we loathe), and a north pole center.</p>

<p>Greenland has been abused on maps for centuries it seems. Like respectable cartographers, we messed up Greenland on purpose.</p>

<p>All maps of the Earth are projections. In order to project our map, I used Blender's tools which are meant for <a href="http://orange.blender.org/blog/live-lscm-unwrap">texture mapping</a> and <a href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-243/render-baking/">texture map baking</a>. These tools are typically used to <a href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-246/uv-editing/">reduce the amount of stretching</a> on the projection and make it easy to project from one arbitrary surface to another.</p>

<p>The setup involved using two spheres and an image taken from <a href="http://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/">NASA's Blue Marble</a> project. For no particular reason, I chose the sea-level image because it could be easily clamped to produce a distinction between land versus water.</p>

<p>The entire 5400x5400 image was then piped through Adobe Illustrator's Live Trace to produce a crisp beautiful vector image.</p>
