<p class="intro"><a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/">The 48 Hour Film Project</a> is an annual film-making competition. Grey Justice made its debut for Richmond's 2010's competition, and took home two awards. Grey Justice was Richmond's only animated entry.</p>

<p>48 Hour Film Project Richmond: Winner of "Best Use of Character" &amp; "Best Special Effects"</p>

<p>Wray's particular part played in Grey Justice, though small, was a fantastic opportunity to work with some of the Blender community's finest 3D animators. The project was ambitiously headed by Jason Van Gumster, publisher of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blender-Dummies-Jason-van-Gumster/dp/0470400188">Blender For Dummies</a> and the lead of <a href="http://www.handturkeystudios.com">Hand Turkey Studios</a>.  The "International team" worked through <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">SVN</a>, and Blender's <a href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-242/library-linking/">linking system</a> to complete shots among multiple animators across multiple countries over the course of three epic sleepless nights. Below are screenshots of the Wray's animated shots that made the final cut.</p>
