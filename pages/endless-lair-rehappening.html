<p  class="intro"><em>Endless Lair {Re}Happening</em> attempts to simulate the experience of {Re}Happening 2011, but was also an installation at {Re}Happening 2011, and thus was being simultaneously displayed and created during {Re}Happening 2011. Meta, isn't it?</p>

<h2>A Spatial Challenge</h2>
<p>The previous installation of <em>Endless Lair</em> asked players to use their quick reflexes to avoid death with "Quick Time Events". The {Re}Happening game was made by adding a new feature which allows for "Slow User Events". Essentially you stare a still screen until you press a direction. What makes the game difficult is not getting lost.</p>

<p>It's important to note that this project was a collaboration. Lauren Brown, found sitting in this chair (and in four other places), did roughly half of the video work.</p>

<p>While at {Re}Happening, attendees who found my game navigated the campus of the former Black Mountain College, now known as Camp Rockmont. I gave each pathway a name, and a cardinal direction to assist in the players' mental map building. The "score" and "lives" were carry-overs from previous code written for Endless Lair: Ninja, though {Re}Happening actually involves no scoring or life-losing whatsoever. A select few players found this so terribly irritating, that they mashed on the "Attack" button wildly trying to kill people who appeared in the still frames, including people who stood much farther away than arms-reach. I couldn't help but ask them "Why would you want to do such a thing?" to which most of them would reply "because there's an attack button." I thought that to be an unfortunate answer.</p>

<p>Players who are patient enough will find me in the Gymnasium beside the same game which they are playing. After proceeding forward, the camera appears to sit down to play. This playful "meta" moment reinforces the idea that the the {Re}Happening game is only a copy of where players currently were in real physical space, and that at any point they have the option of truly "exiting" the vortex by getting out of their seat, and walking away from the game entirely. The reward for discovering this little joke is that the environment switches from day to night when everything happening in the simulation really was occuring outside. Most of these stages were not created quickly enough for most players to experience them virtually, but I tried my best to be running around capturing, coming back and editing, and then converting and programming in new levels as the night went on. I also figured that if players really wanted to know what was beyond the next screen, and I hadn't completed it yet, they really should just stop playing the game, go outside, and see for themselves.</p>

<p>While the {Re}Happening Game acted as a deterrent against videogame obsession during the installation, in it's completed form it stands as a rich archive of the entire evening for anyone who couldn't be there. I wanted to be able to bring the experience home for my friends and family, too. Pieces of fabric from the installation "We Can Only Work" come included in the first run of CD-ROMs to give buyers something tangible, and the proceeds are being donated to next year's event.</p>

<p>Not every installation was represented faithfully. This screen I playfully titled the "Bottles Junction." It's a unique screen in which I walked back and forth inside of an installation that was comprised of a lot of hanging plastic bottles. To get out of it, the player has to press forward in time. If you wait until after the first pass, it turns you around.</p>

<p>Some artists had somewhat deprecated installations due to the misbehaving weather. Thankfully, some of the artists, like this guy, were nice enough to put on a show for the camera, understanding that even if they couldn't keep their piece out in the rain all night, getting it into the game would help immortalize it.</p>

<p>My favourite moments in {Re}Happening are those that are completely candid. One of the key concepts of a happening is that no one is supposed to be a silent observer. To come is to participate. I cherish the thought that I somehow turned everyone who only came to watch in to a character, and that meanwhile all the artists who stood in one place all night will have the opportunity to make the tables turn.</p>

<h2>Hats Off to Hypercard</h2>
<p>Keeping hold of the tradition set by the previous editions of Endless Lair, The {Re}Happening game is an homage to Hypercard-style games like The X-Files for PC, and the ever-famous Myst series.</p>
<p>{Re}Happening presented itself as a huge challenge to compile because it did not take advantage of any kind of crowd-sourcing. All of the content was either captured by myself, or by my one assistant, Lauren Brown. There were no chances for second takes, as everything was captured in the moment. The nature of happenings is that while you are experiencing one thing in one place, you are always missing something else in another. Though the game attempts to capture as much as possible, it is also not completely definitive or omnipotent. The capturing process was limited to my personal physicality in time and space. Completing the editing for {Re}Happening took an additional two months.</p>

<p>Some additional segments were provided by {Re}Happening Organizer, Gene A. Felice a few months later. Special thanks to Gene for giving me access to his large archive of video shot during the event.</p>
