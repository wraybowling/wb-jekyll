<p class="intro"><em>School of Ants</em> is a science project where citizens of the contiguous United States are encouraged to collect ants in their backyard. I built their web site while doing work for <a href="http://intuvoe.com">Intuvoe</a>.</p>

<p>Scientists at NC State and Florida University needed a system that would allow them to accept hundreds of ant-collection kits from users. We decided to use Drupal for its modularity. Users are able to have accounts and submit multiple kit logs, scientists are able to manage their very large taxonomic database and identify specimens, and everyone can see the results on the map. The thing I like about this project the most is that it is building up a searchable database. You can see what ants live near your address without necessarily collecting specimens yourself.</p>
