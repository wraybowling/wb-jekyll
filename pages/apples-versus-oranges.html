<p class="intro">There are so many things in our lives. It can be devastatingly difficult to ask a question as big as "What's your favorite thing?"</p>

<p>By way of user-submitted entries and continuous user voting, <em>Apples Versus Oranges</em> is a cross between <a href="http://kittenwar.com/">Kitten War!</a> and an on-going debate my brother and I had about our favorite video games, movies, superheros, foods, and everything else.</p>

<h2>This is Ridiculous</h2>
<img src="img/apples-versus-oranges-2.png">
<p><em>Apples Versus Oranges</em> is a comedy of wordplay. The emergent juxtaposition of words occasionally results in hilariously unexpected results, because they are either pointedly ironic (Cardboard Box versus Poseidon) or based on the user's experience. More commonplace entries often yield even funnier comparisons (Facepainting versus Poop) &mdash; a trick familiar to anyone who has ever wasted a perfectly good trip to the kitchen on Magnetic Poetry.</p>

<h2>More Hilarious Outcomes</h2>

<h2>Troll Repellant</h2>

<p>Titles of Wikipedia entries are used as a source for valid things that can be entered. This prevents <em>most</em> trolling. The rest is done manually .</p>

<h2>2013 Reboot</h2>
<p>After a couple of years of stagnation, <em>Apples Versus Oranges</em> received a reboot. The voting algorithm was changed so that new items with low ranks could more easily beat out high ranked items.</p>

<h2>Derivative Work</h2>
<p>Philihp Busby created a derivative work with data that was dumped from that original set.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[I] wrote some SAS code to apply a preference voting algorithm (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">Schulze</a>) to it and determined the best thing ever. It took a while, because apparently doing 2*1162^3 comparisons takes a while, but here it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://philihp.com/toys/applesoranges.html">http://philihp.com/<wbr>toys/applesoranges.html</a></p>

<p>As it turns out, there was a 64-way tie for first place, wins/losses/ratio are shown only for information purposes, to figure out true rank you would have to look at what battles each thing was a part of. But if # of wins is any sort of a tie-breaker, BOOKS takes the title of The Best Thing Ever.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
<p>Many discussions on voting algorithms arose while presenting <em>Apples Versus Oranges</em>. As it turns out, there are a plethora of voting systems that can be implemented to solve a problem. The Schulze method which Philihp favored is one of the most fair and unbiased options, but it also tends to leave up a large number of items in a tie. Alternatively, I could have used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_ranking">Elo Ranking System</a> which gives more points to underdogs who beat out higher ranked opponents. Currently, <em>Apples Versus Oranges</em> is using a method similar to Elo's by swapping positions of opponents when the underdog wins.</p>

<p>Though it initially feels random, much of the innaccuracies of finding the <i>Best Thing in The World</i> is a complete farce in favor of letting individual users actually enjoy themselves. The playful nature of the activity before it became a web site was something my brother and I would do on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Between my brother and I, the subject matter was originally about video games. What ended up making <em>Apples Versus Oranges</em> become what it is today was only because I started to wonder which was better: <i>Comix Zone</i>, one of our all time favorite Sega Genesis games, or Chocolate. Wondering things like that are absurd, and hard to answer because they don't make a lot of sense. Sites like <a href="http://isittuesday.com">isittuesday.com</a> set a precedent in the 2000s with <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/single-serving-site">single serve sites</a>, and I thought this was the perfect vehicle to crowdsource answers to such absurd questions.</p>
