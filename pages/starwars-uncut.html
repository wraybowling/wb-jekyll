<p><a href="http://www.starwarsuncut.com/">Star Wars Uncut</a> was a collaborative project that I found through Vimeo. I chose my favorite scene from Star Wars &mdash; just as Rebel forces are leaving Yavin-4 to attack the Death Star, a squadron of X-Wings floats up above a lush sea of tree-tops and slowly float off in to the sunset. It also includes one of the pivotal lines in the film where Obi-Wan tells luke "<a href="http://www.starwarsuncut.com/newhope/scenes#/scene/413">The Force will be with you</a>" &mdash; Star Wars Uncut's surrogate title for this fifteen second clip.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Models were pieced together from flat digital paintings. Each shot was then played back through the <a href="/?tool=blender">Blender Game Engine</a>, and recorded in <a href="/?series=realtime-animation">realtime</a>.</a>
