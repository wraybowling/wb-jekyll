<p class="intro">Stranded was a geo-spatial video game that transformed Columbia's Indie Grits festival into an alien planet.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<img src="img/stranded-1.png">
<p>Stranded set out to be a fusion between game genres. First, an arcade cabinet which turns out to be just a way to speak to an old man who will buy and sell things to you. After unsuccessfully offering up whatever goods you may think of, he'll sell you an "old Russian comm." Under the instruction of your father, you'll enjoy the next part of the game on your mobile device which asks the player to walk around town covering roughly two miles worth of ground. Once you find a ship piece, it's up to you to solve a paper puzzle.</p>

<blockquote>Your dad just found out you have to make a course change, and it's really bad timing. Who knows who you'll meet, if you'll find the lander's missing parts, or worse. Pick up a vintage Russian GPS for a downtown Columbia scavenger hunt. Good luck, comrades!</blockquote>

<h2>Dithered Graphics</h2>

<p><em>Stranded</em> took advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Bayer Dithering</a> to simulate graphics from PC games of the early to mid 1990s. Many elements were blended together using Photoshop, and then tinted with gradient maps to unify the colors. Then a posterizing filter was added to limit the range to 343 colors (7 levels per channel) and a Bayer dithering pattern was overlayed underneath to dissipate gradients and soft shading. The technique makes the process of creating retro-style graphics go by much faster than if I were to use graphics tools of the era.</p>

<h2>Arcade Cabinet Construction</h2>
<p>Denise's largest task was creating the 6 foot arcade cabinet that housed the peddler where players would start the game.</p>

<h2>Mobile GPS Development</h2>
<p>Geocaching in Columbia is not abundantly popular, so for many players, this was their first time. Unfortunately for them, this GPS isn't as nice and friendly as Google Maps. The web browsers on iPhone and Android offer different methods of getting orientation and compass information which made testing challenging.</p>

<h2>Paper Puzzle Design</h2>
<p>Puzzles in Stranded were designed to be closely tethered to the theme of Indie Grits' 10th year. Knowledge of films, musicians, and Columbia's bout with flood waters were all required to pass each checkpoint.</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<img src="img/stranded-8.jpg">
<p>Over 100 people played the game at Indie bits, 60 geocached, 16 solved a paper puzzle, 6 reached an ending, and 1 person reached the very end. Many people enjoyed the concept because they found it original and explorative.</p>
<p>The only negative feedback received was some players expressed frustration with the quality of their phone's GPS for finding such small containers. Again, I think that is the challenging and rewarding fun of geocaching.</p>

<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Stranded was chosen for Best Experimental Game by judges at Indie Bits 2016.</p>
