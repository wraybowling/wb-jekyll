<h2>Data Visualized Through Your Eyes</h2>
<p><em>Totem Pole</em> challenged the idea that data-driven visualizations need to showcase information through the looking glass of whoever designed the visualization. By using each panel as a way of selecting a subset of the data, users are able to build a one-way visualization and make educated guesses about why the data looks the way it does. The longer a user explores their data, the more insights they may discover. With just the original dataset we build back in 2008, I've found out something different every time I've looked at it.</p>
