<p class="intro">This is the best way I know how to share my collaborative work.</p>

<p>RGBk is designed to let you see <a href="/collaborators">who I get help from</a>, how I approach <a href="/development">development</a>, <a href="/graphic-design">design</a>, <a href="/audio-video">audio, and video</a> separately, and what tools I use to complete my personal and <a href="/client-work">professional</a> projects.</p>

<p><a href="http://waybackmachine.org/*/http://rgbk.org">RGBk.org has been online since 2004</a>. It's changed forms a few times. At some points it was a collaborative space, and at other times it was a personal portfolio. At some point I decided to embrace both ideas. There's a duality between recognizing myself and recognizing the people who help make my larger undertakings more wonderful. RGBk.org is, in that sense, a collective portfolio. It's also a placeholder that thinks forward to when it might grow into something more.</p>

<p>As cheesy and "Web 1.0" as it may sound, RGBk tries to embrace the magic of the hyperlink. I wanted to build something that had a soul and was inter-connected at many corners, giving people a way to pick through my work serendipitously. I want to show others that RGBk is a place for the ideas that are rolling around inside me all the time, and that there are so many more on the way.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
