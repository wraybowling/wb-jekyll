<p class="intro">It's an internet puzzle. It's a geocache. It's a Metal Gear fan game. It's an iPhone web application. It's all of these things in one, and it took about eight weeks to get it all working.</p>

<h2>Play the Game</h2>

<h2>Ahead of its Time</h2>
<img src="img/metal-gear-geo-2.jpg">
<p><em>Metal Gear Geo</em> is <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=df842888-301e-411a-a649-a526ca41cedf">an official Geocache</a>: a container hidden out in the woods that you have to find with a hand-held GPS. Once you do find the container, there is a link provided inside the lid that links you to a web application in which a story unfolds. Cachers then proceed through the rest of the game with a web app as their guide which provides video clues and map coordinate events that run on a series of timers. Cachers must find four checkpoints which contain a secret password so that they can proceed towards the end.</p>
<p>This project has repeatedly been reported as being ahead of its time. Geocachers seldom see things with this kind of effort put into them, and the idea was so radical that it took a lot of convincing on the part of the moderators to let me do it.</p>

<h2>Breaking Into Mobile</h2>
<p>Metal Gear Geo was my first senior capstone project at UNCA. The process started with the intent of making something that was cross-phone compatible, but with a focus for iPhone despite the fact that I did not yet own an iPhone myself. Metal Gear Geo depends heavily on the cacher having a hand-held GPS as they would normally and if they happen to have a smartphone, the web app portion is treated as an enhancement.</p>

<p>The video above is a walkthrough that my friend Marie Claire agreed to do with me to document the cache from beginning to end.</p>
