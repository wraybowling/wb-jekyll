<p class="intro">A living brand concept for coders.</p>

<h2>Logo Concept Sketches</h2>
<p>For <em>Astro</em> I proposed a living brand. The logo's typography and/or mark would thus be visually ever-changing but follow a simple set of rules. This is, after all, what code allows us the freedom to do. Initial sketches were kept very small and loose as to maintain compact proportions and simplicity of code. The starburst was a concept I came back to many times because it is exhibited so often in nature, and from which it is easy to generate a wide variety of variations.</p>

<h2>High Fidelity Mockups</h2>
<p>High fidelity mockups of the promotional website drew inspiration from obvious sources: space exploration. However, I did my best to try coloring that was atypical to the genre. Photographs were made to feel hazy and warm to contrast the typical notion that code is a purely mathematical and cold art. The orange brand color was part of that.</p>

<h2>Subsequent Rewrites</h2>
<p>Astro's website project was taken over and revamped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180521160044/http://astrocodeschool.com/">a few times</a> after my work on the brand. It's interesting to compare my intepretation of their vision of a living breathing thing, and how it became more flat, and structured. Most clients do not have the energy to take concepts and keep running with them until they make it their own.</p>
