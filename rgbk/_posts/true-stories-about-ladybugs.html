<p class="intro">I found a ladybug in my car one summer; then I made a short film about it.</p>

<h2>Changing Wallpapers</h2>
<p>The part about spending my summer programming and changing wallpapers on my desktop is profoundly true. Two frames in the animation feature two actual wallpapers that I rendered for a pair of monitors that were of slightly different sizes. Creating and then aligning each wallpaper to the monitors took longer than the rest of the stop motion animation combined</a> &mdash; partially because I was using Indigo Renderer. <a href="http://vimeo.com/1336272">There's a time-lapse if you want to see it.</a></p>
