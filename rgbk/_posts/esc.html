<p class="intro"><em>Esc</em> was a one-night "escape from exams" where animations were projected onto the main steps of UNC Asheville's library. Unlike outdoor projections done previously, students viewing <em>Esc</em> experienced something different depending on whether they were on the top of the stairs or at the bottom.</p>

<h2>Need a Break?</h2>

<!--<blockquote class="intro">It's crunch time for all the students at the UNCA, so six Multimedia students have decided to lighten the mood with a party. They will be projecting animations and others such things onto the steps of the Ramsey Library. Please come for food, games and, best of all pretty lights &mdash; because everyone could use an escape.</blockquote>-->
<p>Animations included in <em>Esc</em> were meant to evoke a sense of escapism for library goers who were weary after a long day of cramming for exams.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<p>The content conjured up by the team included a variety of effects they thought would pay homage to the school, including our iconic mascot, Rocky the bulldog, running up and down the stairs. Some of the  Students further away from the exhibit could look on to the stairs as if they were watching a movie screen just below the library, viewing the imagery projected onto the front-facing sides of each long step. Those interacting with the illusions and effects up close would see an additional image, which was projected onto the top of each step. The result was a good play between being on or off the exhibit. Patrons seemed to enjoy having conversations with others who were viewing the exhibit from another perspective. To stitch each video together seamlessly, periodically a giant "Esc" key &mdash; like the one on a computer keyboard &mdash; would rise out of the stairs and push itself to "close" the current video. The general public's consensus was that the installation was amusing, thought-provoking and, most importantly, a success. The project was able to bring together roughly two hundred people, approximately 15% of the student body, for a brief escape from the burden of year-end exams.</p>

<h2>Dual Projectors</h2>

<p>To cover the library's steps completely, <em>Esc</em> used two projectors which were aligned from the sides. Each projector displayed an angled view of the stairs that matched the throw of the projector. Josh Miller measured out tall wooden beams for these projectors to stand on. We visited the site four separate nights throughout a two month planning period to align our video with the surface of the stairs.</p>

<h2>Projection Mapping With Quartz</h2>

<p>As the team's programmer, I strategized how the projection mapping technique would function. One machine's Quartz Composer layout picked which video to play next and the position of the playhead while the other acted out the same actions in sync when the command was given. The two systems worked nearly the same except for this synchronization function. Each computer was also loaded with its own set of videos that matched the position of the projector it was connected to. For fine-tuning, the final output was stretched with a custom GLSL shader.</p>
