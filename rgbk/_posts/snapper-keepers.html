<p class="intro">Snapper Keepers are tiny pieces of plastic that snap together with retro designs. Together, they act as a decorative desk toy that you can print off at home and build yourself.</p>

<h2>A little experiment</h2>
<p>Snapper Keepers involved researching a material known as shrink plastic. The most commonly known brand of shrink-plastic is Shrinky Dinks. One kind of Shrinky Dink in particular allows one to print onto the plastic with an inkjet printer before the pieces are shrunk. This was the material that I chose to work with.</p>

<p>Much of the research involved had to do with color calibration and measuring the precise amount of shrinkage. Upon shrinking, pigment transfered onto the sheets condenses and makes colors darker and if blacks are made too dark it can cake up. After measuring the difference between unshrunk colors with their shrunken counterparts, I determined that printing on shrink plastic requires lightening by 58% for its 42% reduction.</p>
