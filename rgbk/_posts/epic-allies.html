<p class="intro">I created art and designs for a prototypical version of a mobile health app called <em>Epic Allies</em> while working for <a href="http://caktusgroup.com">Caktus Group</a>. The goal of the application was to encourage young men with HIV to take their daily medication. Research was conducted by a partnership between Duke University and UNC Chapel Hill to conduct tests on whether gamification increased the likelihood of participants taking their meds. My role at Caktus was working on designing the game, creating art assets for it, and providing front-end code (styles, animations, etc) that was performant on mobile phones.</p>

<h2>Mood Boards</h2>
<p>Pinterest was leveraged for maintaining moodboards for this project because of its ability to loosely scrapbook ideas. We maintained a mixture of images pulled from around the web and our own drawings to augment the overall feel. This task is really what Pinterest was meant for, and when multiple members of a team share a pinboard, ideas solidify very quickly. Without Pinterest, we would have ended up with a very different art style.</p>

<h2>Logo Designs</h2>
<p><em>Epic Allies</em> passed through multiple iterations including a number of name changes. Each time we started fresh, I came up with a few logo options; this helped set the tone for the project. The final logo was created in Blender and rendered in Cycles</p>

<h2>Background Paintings</h2>
<p>Backgrounds were created completely in Photoshop. The technique employed was a mixture of vector masks and raster fills to give the graphics a paper cutout look but minus the shadows so that it was flat, but textured. Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/fabmud/outdoors-mood-board/">mood</a> <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/fabmud/map-moodboard/">boards</a> seemed to be inspired most by Genndy Tartakovsky's concept art for Samurai Jack.</p>

<h2>Character Concepts</h2>
<p>I imagined the main character. His distinguishing feature was a turban with a long flowing piece of cloth that blew in the wind. Powers were workshopped through playing with index cards, and art style was I'd say less informed by <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/fabmud/character-mood-board/">the character moodboards</a>, and more informed by the backgrounds.

<h2>Gameplay Design</h2>
<p>Calvin, lead programmer on the project, and I sat down many times to imagine the gameplay aspects on Epic Allies with simple index cards. This later transformed into a collectable card mechanic.</p>

<h2>Battle Screen</h2>
<p>Battle screen concepts were lifted directly from Earthbound. I'm not even going to pretend like I didn't steal that.</p>

<h2>Interface Designs</h2>
<p>User flow was considered at many multiple stages. We took advantage of whiteboard drawings and a rapid prototyping tool called <a href="https://marvelapp.com/pop/">POP (Prototyping on Paper)</a>. Later, when the flow felt right, higher fidelity mockups were made.</p>

<h2>Tracking</h2>
<p>Users were expected to track their medication use, and so visualizing progress was crucial to the user experience. We found that users wanted to track things other than just medication, so mood and exercise were included. The mood tracking was heavily inspired by k10k's MoodStats, and later would inform design decisions in <a href="/joystation">JoyStation</a>. Other features were somewhat borrowed or inspired by other available reminder apps that were available at the time.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If I could go back and do this project over again, I would emphasize the tracking of taking your medication more. We were directed to make something fun that had the feel of a game, and I think that somewhat distracted from the primary objectives. I still can't help but wonder if the act of taking a pill could in itself be the game, wiping away the need for collectable cards and battle sequences. It's an idea I'd still like to explore some day.</p>
