<p class="intro"><em>UBR HAX</em> is a self portrait of Ivan Kramskoi wearing shutter shades that was hacked into the <em>Graffiti</em> Facebook app.</p>

<h2>Under The Hood</h2>
<p><em>UBR HAX</em> was transferred with an automated process one dot at a time. To do this I wrote a sketch in Processing and made heavy use of a Java class called <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">Robot</a>. In essense, Robot can do anything that a human can do with a computer but without any delay. Using Processing, I sampled pixels from Ivan's portrait. After that Robot carefully changed Graffiti's color by clicking the picker and emulating key commands to type in a hex code. Finally it moves the mouse to the next position and clicks the screen to add a point of the new color. While the replay flies by in a few seconds, the actual process took about eight hours.</p>

<h2>Don't Try This at Home</h2>
<p>I have kept this process by which I made <em>UBR HAX</em> a secret for many years and it is not because I want to be mean. There is a real danger in using Java's Robot. On numerous occasions I made the mistake of moving the cursor before test runs were complete and there was no way to get back to Processing to make the application stop. If you want to play around with Robot, I strongly recommend that you connect a joystick of some kind to your computer and make one of the buttons a kill switch. One time in particular, I tried just a touchpad gesture to return to the desktop, and it started clicking on folders furiously until there were thousands of windows open making Mac OS fall to its knees. So instead I think it's safer to say "don't try this at home."</p>

<h2>Who Is Ivan Kramskoi?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Kramskoi">Ivan Nikolovich Kromskoi</a> painted portraits of Civil War generals in the early 1800s. He also happens to look exactly like me but with slightly fancier facial hair. The portrait was found by <a href="/collaborators#adam-crane">Adam</a> by accident and I've used it on numerous occasions when doing something dubious.</p>
