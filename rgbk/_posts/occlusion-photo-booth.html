<p class="intro">A giant Rubik's cube passed right through this man's chest and a whole room of people watched it happen. <em>Occlusion Photo Booth</em> is hard to explain without this photo. This is what was happening at SPARKcon as part of the <em>Digital Motion Showcase</em>.</p>

<h2>An "Augmented Projection Playground"</h2>

<p>Without a good word or precedent for what Occlusion Photo Booth was trying to be, the flyer called it an "augmented projection playground." Augmented reality is often thought of as a translucent screen that one person wears. Google Glass is a prime example. We wanted to think of a way that everyone in a room could see what was happening. The best way to do this was with projection. With the Kinect, and Rippy's experience with C, we gained instant knowledge about what we were projecting onto. Thus our projection surface could be constantly changing. As soon as we realized it could be a moving person, we had to see if we could incorperate these sorts of projection mapping tricks onto people the same way projection mapping artists had been applying optical illusions to buildings. Later of course, we decided to call it a "photo booth" since that more clearly explained how we wanted patrons to interact with the exhibit. It's also less of a mouth-full.</p>
