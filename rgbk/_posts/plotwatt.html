<h2>Plotwatt: The Company</h2>
<p>Plotwatt is a startup that logs a user's energy usage &amp; breaks it up into tangible appliance categories. <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-02-22/opinion/28617528_1_smartmeter-electric-grid-solar-power">The San Fransisco Chronicle</a> describes it as a service that "offers device-by-device details on energy consumption."</p>

<h2>The Visualization Process</h2>
<p>It was my aim to produce a visualization that helped one understand that data's changes through time. Seen below is the original dataset that Plotwat included in their open call for visualizations.</p>

<p>The original set was very jittery, so I quickly realized I would have to smooth it out. I used an animation technique of easing circles size relative to their previous size and applying the new size as a target. This helped average out each point on the graph by a time factor of about ten so that peaks wouldn't be lost in a mess of ups and downs.</p>
<p>After the circles were properly sizing on screen, I captured the sketch's output as a movie and formatted it for iPad.</p>
<p>The rest of the process involved carefully photographing the video playback on the iPad. This style is reminiscent of the iPad light painting project "<a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/09/14/magic-ipad-light-painting/">Making Future Magic</a>" by Dentsu &amp; BERG. I owe them a lot of credit for the idea of using my iPad for rendering 3D in the real world.</p>

<p>The last puzzle piece in the image shows how the circles interplay with one another. Each circle positions itself at one designated angle, but its position from the center is dependent on outlier status (by being outside the white ring) or the central source of power use (close to the center).</p>
