<p class="intro">The Jazzmutant Lemur was once the pinnacle of MIDI controllers &mdash; then the iPad killed it. Before the iPad, the <em>Lemur Clone</em> was a cheap alternative to the original.</p>

<h2>How it Happened</h2>
<p>Between 2007 and 2010, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemur_Input_Device">Jazz Mutant Lemur</a> was a highly desirable piece of hardware &amp; software that allowed a musician to create their own multi-touch MIDI control surface. Lemurs were very expensive, however, with a standard unit costing $1,999. I had grown tired of waiting for the price to come down, and the iPad hadn't been invented yet, so I decided to build one of my own with <a href="/?tool=processing">Processing</a>, a web cam, a cardboard box, and a clear airvent cover.</p>

<p>Given my knowledge of object oriented programming, it didn't seem too hard to make a singular module that understood one multi-touch event, and converted that coordinate in to a 0â€“128 ranged number for use as a MIDI output.</p>
