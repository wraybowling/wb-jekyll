<p><a href="http://www.mirascape.com">Mirascape</a> is a mobile web site and android app that aggregates content &amp; deals from multiple social networks. It's owned by Neogence, whom I worked for during the latter part of 2010. My involvement with the company was in designing much of the functionality of the site, and almost all of the front-end HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>I strived to use as many CSS tricks as possible such as browser-rendered transparent gradients for a minimal amount of background images. Secondly, I engineered the feature that makes the site completely transform for mobile browsers or smaller windows &mdash; just like RGBk.org does today.</p>

<p>Occasionally I did a few side-projects that were very interesting. Most of them involved utilizing our API for the heavy lifting and visualizing data with the Google Maps API. Some of that experience translated well to their "Places" page where I made a map that only queries the database for pins within the viewing region, and automatically garbage-collects pins that leave the viewing region.</p>

<p>I also spent a hillarious amount of time repeatedly revising code to make the most absolutely perfect double-bordered buttons. By the third version, I had giant testing beds that looked like this, wallpapered with pictures of Mr. T. It might not seem like a big deal to put two borders and a drop shadow on a row of X number of buttons while keeping them evenly sized even when the page resizes, but trust me, it was.</p>
