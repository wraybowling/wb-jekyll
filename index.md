My name is Wray Bowilng. I've been an interaction designer and web developer since the early days of the World Wide Web. From 2001-2019, I organized a digital multimedia art collective called RGBk. I'm also a self-published musician, and founded the synthesizer brand Swamp Flux. I live on a farm in the midlands of South Carolina.
