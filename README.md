# Work In Progress :)

I maintained roughly 4-5 portfolio websites over the many years I've been a web designer. For this new one, I'm trying to combine them all into one, iteratively.

## The Plan

My plan is to "re-release" articles, tweets, essays, and behind-the-scenes content from my archives spanning 20+ years. Posts will be enhanced, dead links will be repaired to the best of my ability. For fact verification, and spell checking, I'm going to still [rely on peer reviews](https://github.com/wraybowling/wb-jekyll/pulls) like I did with my previous website, but this time it will happen more frequently.

## Tech Stack

Because I'm a web developer, you probably came here to see what fancy tech stack I'm using, did you? Well, you came to the wrong place. This site runs on Jekyll & GitHub Pages so that I can focus on content instead. As it turns out, writing code for the web all day makes me experience extreme amounts of burnout when I get home, so it's the last thing I want to think about. In minor aspects though, because I do have control over how things are built, I am trying to see if I can push the visual wow factor a bit with the least amount of infrastructure. This might mean CSS, or native web components. At the time of this writing, I'm not sure. Whatever I've done, if you're the least bit savvy, I'm sure browsing the source code will explain what I've done here. I'm going to keep it pretty vanilla here. OK? Cool.
